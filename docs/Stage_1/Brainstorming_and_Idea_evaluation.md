# Portfolio Project
## Team Formation, Brainstorming, and MVP
### Brainstorming and Idea Evaluation
#### Step 1: Research and Idea Generation
- **Individual Research:** Each team member explored existing TCG collection apps, analyzed their strengths and weaknesses, and studied public APIs available for different TCG franchises.
- **Group Brainstorming:** Conducted a session using these techniques:
  - **Mind Mapping:** Visualized connections between multiple TCG franchises, user needs, and potential features of a universal app.
  - **SCAMPER Framework:**
    - **Substitute:** Replace multiple single-TCG apps with one consolidated platform.
    - **Combine:** Merge the best features of existing apps into a single solution.
    - **Adapt:** Adapt existing card collection management features (search, filter, track value) for multiple TCGs.
    - **Modify:** Improve UI/UX for users who collect cards from multiple franchises.
    - **Put to another use:** Use public APIs to dynamically update card databases across franchises.
    - **Eliminate:** Remove redundancy caused by managing separate apps for each TCG.
    - **Reverse:** Allow exploration of cards not only by franchise but also by rarity, type, or value.
  - **“How Might We” Questions:**
    - How might we consolidate multiple TCG collections into a single app?
    - How might we combine the best features of existing apps while keeping it simple and user-friendly ?
    - How might we provide seamless access to multiple franchises through public APIs?

#### Step 2: Idea Evaluation
- **Evaluation Criteria:**
  - Feasibility: Can the team integrate multiple APIs and handle different data formats ?
  - Potential Impact: Will it significantly improve the experience for multi-TCG collectors ?
  - Technical Alignment: Do the app’s requirements match the team’s skills (frontend, backend, ML/AI) ?
  - Scalability: Can the platform support adding more TCG franchises in the future ?

- **Project Idea:** Multi-TCG Collection App
  - **Description:** A unified digital platform that allows collectors to track, manage, and explore multiple TCG collections in one place. The app combines the best features of existing apps while supporting multiple franchises through public APIs.
  - **ML/AI Feature:** Integrates card recognition via the camera to automatically identify cards and add them to the user’s collection. The feature already exists in some apps, but it will be recoded and adapted to work with multiple franchises.
  - **Feasibility:** High. APIs exist, team skills cover frontend, backend, and ML/AI integration.
  - **Challenges & Risks:** Integrating multiple APIs with varying formats, maintaining performance for large collections, recoding the ML/AI recognition feature to work across different card designs, and providing a smooth user experience.
  - **Potential Impact:** High. Reduces friction for collectors managing multiple TCGs, automates card input via camera recognition, and creates a central hub for card tracking and exploration.
