## 1 Potential impact
The current TCG ecosystem forces collectors to use multiple apps, one per franchise (Magic, Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh! etc...).
- **Reason for Selection:**
    - High relevance to the needs of collectors managing multiple TCG franchises.
    - Combines the best features of existing apps in a single platform.
    - Feasible with the current team’s skills (frontend, backend, ML/AI integration).
    - High potential impact for users by reducing friction, improving collection management, and automating card identification.

---

## 2 Problem it solves
- Collectors must manually enter cards or switch between several apps.
- Multi-TCG collectors have no centralized, unified tool.
- Camera scanning features exist but only for single franchises.
- Managing large collections across different systems is time-consuming.

---

## 3 Proposed solution
- **web based, mobile responsive application** that provides:
- **Multi franchise support** using public APIs
- **Universal card collection management**
- **ML/AI card recognition** to scan cards via camera
- **Search, filter, analytics, and export tools**
- **A unified hub for all TCG collections**

## 4 Why This MVP ?
- Aligns perfectly with team expertise (frontend, backend, ML/AI).
- Presents a realistic but meaningful challenge.
- High value for real TCG communities.
- Provides a foundation that can easily grow into a scalable full product.

## 5 User Stories
**Core Features (MVP):**
1. **As a collector**, I want to scan a Pokémon or Magic card with my phone camera so that it is automatically identified and added to my collection
2. **As a collector**, I want to search for cards by name, set, or rarity so that I can verify if I already own them
3. **As a collector**, I want to view my total card count and estimated collection value so that I can track my collection's growth
4. **As a collector**, I want to mark cards as "wanted" so that I know which ones I'm actively looking for
5. **As a new user**, I want to create a secure account so that my collection is saved across all my devices

**Future Enhancements (Post-MVP):**
- **As a collector**, I want to export my collection to CSV so that I can share it with other collectors
- **As a collector**, I want to filter and sort my cards by edition, rarity, or value so that I can organize my collection efficiently
- **As a collector**, I want to add duplicate counts for each card so that I can track how many copies I own
